<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project üìö


[![Pizza Sales Analysis Screenshot](https://github.com/yassineeea/Carbon-FootPrint/blob/main/CarbonDashboard/dash1.png)](https://example.com)


The Carbon Footprint Analysis project was designed to explore and understand global carbon emissions trends, focusing on the contributions of various countries and energy sources. By analyzing an extensive dataset of CO2 emissions, this project aimed to uncover insights that could inform policy decisions, guide sustainable practices, and support efforts to mitigate climate change.


#### Goals üéØ
* Identify Top Contributors ü•á: Determine which countries and energy sources contribute most to total carbon emissions.
* Analyze Emissions Trends üìà: Understand the annual, regional, and global trends in carbon emissions to support informed decision-making.
* Insights on Carbon Intensity üåç: Assess the relationship between carbon emissions and economic output (GDP) to evaluate the efficiency of different countries in managing their carbon footprint.


### Built With ‚õèÔ∏èüßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª
To navigate the data analyst job market, I enlisted a powerful toolkit:

- **[![SQL][SQL-badge]][SQL-url]** served as the foundation, enabling me to explore and clean database to extract valuable insights.
- **[![Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio][SSMS-badge]][SSMS-url]** Provided a familiar environment for database interaction and executing SQL queries.
- **[![Power BI][PowerBI-badge]][PowerBI-url]** Utilized for creating interactive dashboards.
- **[![Git][Git-badge]][Git-url] [![GitHub][GitHub-badge]][GitHub-url]** ensured seamless version control and collaboration by allowing me to track changes and share my SQL scripts and analysis.

<!-- Problem Statement -->
## Problem Statement üìù
We need to analyze the carbon footprint data for various countries over time to gain insights into global and regional carbon emissions trends. Specifically, we want to calculate the following key metrics:
### 1. KPI requirements üìå
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
- **Total Carbon Emissions:** The sum of all CO2 emissions from various sources (e.g., cement, coal, gas, oil).
- **Per Capita Carbon Emissions:** Compute the average carbon emissions per person by dividing the total carbon emissions by the population of each country.
- **Energy Consumption by Source:** Analyze the total energy consumption from various sources (e.g., coal, gas, oil) for each country and year
- **Carbon Intensity of GDP:**  The amount of carbon emissions per unit of GDP, calculated by dividing total carbon emissions by the GDP of each country.
- **Carbon Emissions Growth Rate:** The percentage change in total carbon emissions from one year to the next, to assess trends in carbon emissions over time.
- 
### 2. CHARTS REQUIREMENT üìä
We would like to visualize various aspects of our carbon footprint data to gain insights and understand key trends. The following charts will help us achieve this:
- **Annual Trend for Total Carbon Emissions:** Create a line chart that displays the yearly trend of total carbon emissions for each country. This chart will help us identify long-term trends and variations in carbon emissions.
- **Annual Trend of Carbon Emission Per Person:** A line chart to track the trend of per capita carbon emissions over the years, revealing patterns and changes in individual contributions to emissions.

- **Energy Consumption by Source:**  Pie charts or stacked bar charts depicting the breakdown of energy consumption by source (e.g., coal, gas, oil) for each country, offering insights into the primary contributors to carbon emissions.
  
- **Top/Bottom Countries with CO2 Emissions:** Bar charts comparing the CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions per capita across different countries, highlighting both the highest and lowest contributors.
- **CO2 Growth Per Country and Source:** Visualization to show the percentage contribution of CO2 growth by country and by energy source, identifying the main drivers of increasing emissions.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Project Workflow üöÄ


### 1. Data Collection and Preparation üóÇÔ∏è

#### Data Sourceüåê: 
The data was collected from multiple global sources, including the Energy Institute and the U.S. Energy Information Administration, among others.
.[*Our World in Data*](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
#### Data Cleaningüßπ:

### 2. Data Analysis with SQL üîç
#### * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)üîé:
I Performed initial data exploration using SQL queries to understand the distribution of data and identify any anomalies.
#### * KPI Calculationüìä:

I Wrote SQL queries to calculate the required KPIs such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order.
- **1. Total Carbon Emissions:** This query calculates the total CO2 emissions from various sources such as cement, coal, gas, oil, other industries, land use changes, and flaring.
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(cement_co2 + coal_co2 + gas_co2 + oil_co2 + other_industry_co2 + land_use_change_co2 + flaring_co2) AS TotalCarbonEmission
FROM CarbonData;

```
- **2. Average Carbon Emission Per Person:** This query calculates the average carbon emissions per capita by dividing total CO2 emissions by the total population.
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(cement_co2 + coal_co2 + gas_co2 + oil_co2 + other_industry_co2 + land_use_change_co2 + flaring_co2) / SUM(population) AS AverageIndivCarbonEmission
FROM CarbonData;

```
- **3. Total Carbon Emissions by Source:** This query calculates the total CO2 emissions for each source, including coal, gas, oil, other industries, land use changes, and flaring.
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(coal_co2) AS TotalCoalConsumption,
    SUM(gas_co2) AS TotalGasConsumption,
    SUM(oil_co2) AS TotalOilConsumption,
    SUM(other_industry_co2) AS TotalOtherIndustryConsumption,
    SUM(land_use_change_co2) AS TotalLandUseChangeConsumption,
    SUM(flaring_co2) AS TotalFlaringConsumption
FROM CarbonData;

```
- **4. Carbon Intensity of GDP:** This KPI measures the carbon emissions per unit of GDP, calculated by dividing the total carbon emissions by the GDP of each country.
```sql
SELECT 
    (SUM(cement_co2 + coal_co2 + gas_co2 + oil_co2 + other_industry_co2 + land_use_change_co2 + flaring_co2) / SUM(gdp)) AS CarbonIntensityOfGDP
FROM CarbonData;

```

#### * Trend Analysisüìà:
I Used SQL to extract data for daily and monthly trends, enabling the creation of the necessary charts in Power BI.
- **1. Daily Trend of orders :** This query calculates the total number of distinct orders for each day of the week. .
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date)  as order_date , count(distinct order_id) as totalorders     
FROM pizza_sales 
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);
```
- **2. Monthly Trend of orders  :** This query calculates the total number of distinct orders for each month.
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(Month, order_date)  as order_date , count(distinct order_id) as totalorders     
FROM pizza_sales 
GROUP BY  DATENAME(Month, order_date);
```
- **3. Percentages of sales per category  :** This query calculatesThis query calculates the percentage of total sales for each pizza category.
```sql
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(total_price)*100 / (select SUM(total_price)
FROM pizza_sales)  as TotalPrice 

FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;
```
- **4. Top 5 pizzas by revenue   :** This query calculates the total revenue for the top 5 pizza names, ordered by revenue in descending order.
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, Sum(total_price) as TotalRevenue 
FROM pizza_sales 
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```
### 3. Data Visualization with Power BI üìä
- **Dashboard Creation:** Leveraging Power BI, I transformed the processed data into interactive, insightful dashboards that provide a comprehensive view of pizza sales performance over time.

### 4. Business Insights and Reporting üß†

- **Actionable Insights:** The visualized data provides actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions, such as optimizing inventory for the best-selling pizzas, revising marketing strategies for underperforming products, and adjusting pricing models based on customer demand patterns.

- **Performance Monitoring:** These dashboards enable continuous performance monitoring, allowing stakeholders to track progress against sales targets, identify potential issues early on, and respond swiftly to changes in market conditions.
